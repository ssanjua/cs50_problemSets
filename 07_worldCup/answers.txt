Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?: none, this is a simulation, there is no wrong prediction

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?: 10000 simulations seems good enough and 1000 will also do the work
